# BotSpeaker
Python script for Google Smart Speaker AIY Kit. It's a custom Smart Voice Assistant device like Alexa.
The script makes the kit possible to communicate with Microsoft Chat Bot hosted on Azure using Azure Speach-to-Text and Text-to-Speach services. Also the app uses SnowBoy model for offline "hot word" recognition.
